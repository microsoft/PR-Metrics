# Support

## Overview

PR Metrics is provided via Microsoft DevLabs as an experiment from Microsoft,
representing some of the latest ideas around developer tools. The extension is
designed for broad usage and you are encouraged to use and provide feedback on
it.

## Support Lifecycle

PR Metrics follows a rolling release model. Only the **latest release** is
actively supported with bug fixes and security updates. Previous releases do not
receive patches; consumers should upgrade to the latest version to receive fixes.

Each release is identified by a [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)
number (e.g., `v1.7.11`). Patch and minor releases may be issued to address
bugs or security issues. A new release supersedes all prior releases.

## Security Updates

Security vulnerabilities reported through the
[security policy](../SECURITY.md) are assessed and, where applicable, addressed
in the next release. Critical security issues may result in an expedited patch
release.

Once a new version is published, the previous version no longer receives
security updates. Consumers should always run the latest version to benefit from
the most recent security fixes.

## End of Life

As a Microsoft DevLabs project, no formal end-of-life commitments are made.
Should the project become inactive, the last published release will remain
available on the
[GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/microsoft/PR-Metrics/releases) and
the
[Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-omex.PRMetrics),
but will not receive further updates, including security patches.

Consumers will be notified of any planned end of life through a
[GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/microsoft/PR-Metrics/discussions) and an
update to this document.
