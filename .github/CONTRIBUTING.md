## Coding Style

There is an [`.editorconfig`](../.editorconfig) file in the root of the project
specifying some simple formatting guidelines. In addition to adhering to those,
you should follow the pattern of what you see in existing code where possible.

## Code Overview

The repository is organized into a set of different extensions, as outlined in
the [README](../README.md).

## Updating an Extension

Contributions to existing extensions are appreciated.

Any update will need to increment the version in the task's `task.json` and
`vss-extension.json` files. The version numbers follow the
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) rules.

## Adding an Extension

If you wish to create a new extension, please discuss this beforehand using
[GitHub issues](https://github.com/microsoft/PR-Metrics/issues).

The following instructions can be used for adding an extension.

1. If instances of the extension category do not already exist in the repo,
   create a new folder for this category.
1. Within the category folder, create a new folder with the name of the extension.
1. Follow the existing examples as well as the instructions at
   [Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/extend/develop/add-build-task).
1. Add your custom logic.
1. Update the
   [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/microsoft/PR-Metrics/tree/main/.github/workflows)
   to reference your new extension.

## Documentation

Contributions to documentation are always appreciated. Feel free to submit a
pull request to contribute to any existing documentation file. If you wish to
add new documentation, please add it to the `docs` folder.
