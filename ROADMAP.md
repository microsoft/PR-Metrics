# Roadmap

PR Metrics is a mature, stable project. The ongoing roadmap focuses on
maintenance and reliability rather than new feature development.

## Ongoing Priorities

- **Dependency Updates**: Regular updates to all dependencies to address
  security vulnerabilities and maintain compatibility with current platform
  versions.
- **Platform Compatibility**: Continued support for both GitHub Actions and
  Azure DevOps Pipelines as these platforms evolve.
- **Bugfixes**: Resolution of any reported issues as they arise.
- **Community Support**: Responding to issues and reviewing community
  contributions.

## Out of Scope

- Major new features or significant architectural changes are not planned.
- Support for additional CI/CD platforms beyond GitHub Actions and Azure
  Pipelines is not planned.

## Feature Requests

If you have a feature request, please open a [GitHub issue][githubissues].
Feature requests will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis by the maintainers.
